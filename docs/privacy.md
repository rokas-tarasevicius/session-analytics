# Privacy contract

`session-analytics` reads coding-agent transcripts that already exist on your machine. Those transcripts contain everything you and your agents have written: prompts, responses, reasoning, commands, file paths, diffs, and tool output. This document defines exactly what the tool may return from them, how that boundary is enforced, and what it does not protect against.

The contract applies to every output surface: the dashboard and its `/api/analytics` endpoint, the terminal report, the JSON snapshot (`report --json`), and the agent skill, which only runs those commands.

## The contract

**Returned:** allowlisted counters and identifiers only.

- Token counters by class, cost figures, counts of events, durations, and ISO timestamps.
- Model IDs and reasoning-effort labels as the provider recorded them.
- Tool names, and skill identifiers that match `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._:-]{0,127}$`.
- A repository display name and a stable repository ID.
- A session key: the first 12 hex characters of a SHA-256 hash of the provider-qualified session ID.
- Fixed-text parser warnings, which may include counts and model IDs.
- The rate card's effective date, model IDs, and public source URLs.

**Never returned:**

- prompts, user messages, assistant messages, or reasoning text;
- tool arguments, tool results, commands, diffs, or patch content;
- file paths, transcript paths, working directories, repository roots, or Git remotes;
- raw session, provider, workspace, or message IDs;
- session titles, branch names, or workspace names;
- credentials, environment variables, or process arguments;
- raw local error messages or stack traces.

## How it is enforced

- **Allowlist projection.** Parsers accumulate counters into an internal session state, and `finalizeSession` in `src/analyzer.ts` builds each public object field by field. Raw provider records are never spread into an output, so a new field in a provider's format cannot reach an output without a code change.
- **Internal-only types.** `SessionDatabaseRow` and `AnalyzeOptions` in `src/types.ts` carry paths, titles, branches, and IDs for correlation. They are used inside the analysis process and are not part of any public type.
- **Bounded derived names.** Skill identifiers must match the pattern above. Tool names come from the provider's structured tool-call records. The one exception is Codex code mode, where a single transported call can run several tools: the parser matches `tools.<name>(` in the call input and accepts only identifier characters (`[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]*`) as the name.
- **Sentinel tests.** Fixtures plant strings such as `secret-command`, `secret-path`, `secret-skill-args`, and `content-is-not-returned` in prompts, tool inputs, Cursor bubbles, Codex items, and streamed Claude content. Tests in `test/analyzer.test.ts`, `test/accounting.test.ts`, and `test/server.test.ts` serialize the full output and fail if any sentinel, transcript path, workspace name, remote, or raw session UUID appears.
- **Generic errors.** The server maps every failure to one of three fixed messages. The analysis worker's standard error is discarded rather than forwarded, so local paths in exceptions cannot reach the dashboard.
- **No exfiltration path.** The tool makes no network requests and has no telemetry. The dashboard is served from `127.0.0.1` with a Content Security Policy that only allows same-origin resources. See [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.
- **Read-only access.** JSONL transcripts are streamed and SQLite databases are opened with `readOnly: true`. Nothing is written to provider directories.

Content is held in memory only while a line is being parsed. It is not cached, logged, or written anywhere. Opt-in reliability matching retains only HMACs and bounded counters until the execution stream finishes, then discards the HMACs. Out-of-order receipts retain numeric codes/durations and fixed error-rule enums, never result text. Structured Codex read paths enter the bounded HMAC extractor only with P2 enabled. Neither the key nor any path/argument digest enters the public snapshot.

## Privacy tiers

Every field belongs to a tier. The tiers also govern planned features (see [roadmap.md](roadmap.md)).

| Tier | Contents | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **P0** | Counts, token counters, costs, timestamps, durations, model IDs, tool and skill names, enumerated labels | Returned today |
| **P1** | Pseudonymous keys and identifying metadata: session keys, repository IDs and display names, MCP server names; internal keyed hashes of paths/arguments | Keys, repository metadata and MCP server names returned; reliability digests stay internal |
| **P2** | Results of local rules over commands, tool arguments and failed results, where only class IDs and counts leave the parser | Reliability rules are opt-in, off by default |
| **P3** | Text shown to you or sent to an LLM, such as an opt-in session review | Not implemented; will be opt-in per run, stored separately, and labeled |

P2 and P3 features are off by default. `--reliability-content-rules` (or `SESSION_ANALYTICS_RELIABILITY_CONTENT_RULES=1`) enables the reliability rules for a scan. `--no-reliability-content-rules` explicitly disables them. Structured outcomes, durations, hook/permission enums and MCP names do not require this option.

When enabled, reliability matching creates a random 32-byte HMAC-SHA256 secret in `reliability-hmac.key` with mode **0600**. The data directory is `--data-dir`, then `SESSION_ANALYTICS_DATA_DIR`, then `~/Library/Application Support/session-analytics` on macOS or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/session-analytics` (default `~/.local/share/session-analytics`) on other platforms. Only this key is persisted; no reliability event index is written. Creation is atomic across concurrent scans; existing keys are never overwritten. Symlinked, malformed, wrong-owner or permissive key files are refused. If key access fails, hashing and its flags become unavailable without exposing a path or error string. Default scans never create this key. Provider stores remain read-only.

## Field manifest

This manifest lists every field in the public snapshot. It is generated from the types in [`src/types.ts`](../src/types.ts); a change to those types must update this table in the same pull request. Metric semantics are defined in [metrics.md](metrics.md).

### Reliability (`SessionReliability`)

Public types live in [`src/metrics/reliability-types.ts`](../src/metrics/reliability-types.ts), referenced and re-exported by `src/types.ts`. All fields below are under `sessions[].reliability`. MCP server/tool names are bounded to 128 identifier characters; invalid names become `unknown`. No raw provider object is copied into this namespace.

| `hooks.runs`, `hooks.blocks` | Hook runs and summaries blocking continuation | P0 |
| `permissions.denials` | Denied tool calls | P0 / P2 if inferred from failed text |
| `permissions.modes` | Counts of `default`, `auto`, `bypassPermissions`, `plan`, `acceptEdits`, `dontAsk`, `unknown` observations | P0 |

| `apiErrors` | Structured `api_rate_limit`, `api_server_error`, `unknown` counts | P0 |

The dashboard and report derive class/repository/agent comparisons, coverage denominators, episode totals and guarded rates from these fields. The public JSON contains no per-call events and no additional reliability root rollup. Tests in `test/reliability.test.ts` and `test/server.test.ts` cover sentinels through the parser, child worker, API and report, including error text, diffs, command arguments, hooks and MCP results.

### Token usage (`TokenUsage`)

Appears as `session.tokens` and inside every model usage entry.

| Field | Meaning | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inputTokens` | Processed input: uncached input plus cache reads plus cache writes | P0 |
| `uncachedInputTokens` | Input billed at the base input rate | P0 |
| `cachedInputTokens` | Cache-read input | P0 |
| `cacheWriteInputTokens` | Cache-write input (Claude) | P0 |
| `cacheWrite5mInputTokens` | Cache writes with a 5-minute TTL | P0 |
| `cacheWrite1hInputTokens` | Cache writes with a 1-hour TTL | P0 |
| `outputTokens` | Output, including reasoning | P0 |
| `reasoningOutputTokens` | Reasoning or thinking output, where recorded separately | P0 |
| `nonReasoningOutputTokens` | Output minus reasoning output | P0 |

### Cost breakdown (`CostBreakdown`)

Appears as `session.cost` and inside every model usage entry. All values are USD.

| Field | Meaning | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inputUsd` | Uncached input value | P0 |
| `cachedInputUsd` | Cache-read value | P0 |
| `cacheWriteUsd` | Cache-write value | P0 |
| `outputUsd` | Output value | P0 |

| `upperEstimateUsd` | Total plus the cache-write premium on all uncached input where cache writes are not observable | P0 |

### Model usage (`ModelUsage`)

Appears in `session.models[]` and every `spendByModel[]`. Includes every `TokenUsage` and `CostBreakdown` field, plus:

| Field | Meaning | Tier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model` | Model ID as recorded by the provider (`<unknown>` when none was recorded) | P0 |
| `calls` | Requests attributed to this model | P0 |
| `priced` | `true` when the rate card has an entry for this model (always `true` for Cursor provider-reported values) | P0 |

### Health endpoint

`GET /api/health` returns `{ service: "session-analytics", snapshot: "ready" | "building" | "not-started", status: "ok" }`. All fields are P0.

### Browser storage

The dashboard stores two values in `localStorage`: the selected view (`session-analytics-view`) and the theme (`session-analytics-theme`). Nothing else is persisted.

## What this does not protect against

- **Your own account.** Anyone or anything that can read your home directory can read the raw transcripts directly. This tool does not encrypt, move, or delete provider history.
- **Other local processes.** Any process on your machine can request `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/api/analytics` while the dashboard runs. It receives the same content-free snapshot you see.
- **Identifying metadata.** Repository names, model IDs, and timestamps can be sensitive. A repository named after an unannounced project reveals that name. Review a JSON snapshot or screenshot before sharing it; for public material, use the synthetic demo (`npm run demo`).

## Changing the contract

A pull request that adds or changes a public field must:

1. add the field to the public types in `src/types.ts` and populate it explicitly (no spreading of provider records);
2. add a row to the field manifest above, with its tier;
3. define its semantics in [metrics.md](metrics.md);
4. add or extend a test that plants sentinel content in the relevant provider records and asserts it does not appear in the serialized output.

Fields in P2 or P3 additionally need an explicit opt-in that is off by default.
